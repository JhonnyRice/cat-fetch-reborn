## CatFetch Reborn
Fast fetch program written in bash!

v. 0.5.1

The ascii cat is made by [me](https://github.com/jhonnyrice).

## MACOS BETA IS OUT!
Go and try the new mac os beta!
please if you encounter an issue, report that in a github issue

### Features
* Fast. Not as fast as the old cat-fetch, but still really fast
* Good WM detection. It can still have bugs, but its ultra fast, because it doesn't need to search processes for the WM's in a process list, wich is a very slow method
* Cute. Cats are cute.
* Lots of info. There are lots of info that this fetch can display, and we're adding even more! from the current shell to the graphical session to RAM usage.
The fetch does not work? you encounter some bugs? Create a github issue and we will fix it!*


*Fixes can take up to a day or more
